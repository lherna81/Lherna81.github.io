<h2> Why its my favorite movie </h2>

<div id="intro"> 
<p>My favorite marvel movie is Avengers Endgame. It consists of almost every 
    character marvel studios has introduced in marvels cinematic universe(MCU). 
    This was the last movie where we would see all the original actors whom were 
    considered the best characters in the MCU all at once fighting.

It was the sequal from Avengers infinity war, when it was the first time the Avengers
actually lost. Not only did they lose, they lost their loved ones and half of the universe 
was destroyed. They pulled off the impossible and that was to unite once more to revive their 
loved ones, while sacrificing unexpected things along the way. They did it for the greater good, 
to bring back the other half of the universe that was snapped away from the main villain named 
Thanos. He used the infitity stones that allowed him to control several laws of reality
to collect all 6 of them which allowed him to wipe out half of existence. The avengers 
united for one final battle where it decided the victor to be the avengers where they were able to bring
back everyone, which took great sacrifices in the end.
